This KiCad project showcases the design of a smart switch system built around the ESP32 microcontroller, aimed at enhancing automation and energy monitoring in residential or commercial settings. The system integrates both 5V and 3.3V low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulators to ensure stable power delivery to the ESP32 and associated components. An AC-DC converter is used to step down and convert mains voltage into usable DC power, making the switch compatible with standard household wiring. Additionally, the circuit incorporates voltage and current sensors to enable real-time power consumption monitoring, allowing users to track energy usage and implement protective features. The layout is optimized for compactness and reliability, with clear signal routing and robust power distribution.
